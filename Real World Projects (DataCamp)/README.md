### SQL Projects
- [Analyzing Electric Vehicle Charging Habits](https://github.com/TerekliTahaBerk/sql-portfolio/tree/main/Real%20World%20Projects%20(DataCamp)/Analyzing%20Electric%20Vehicle%20Charging%20Habits): This project examines patterns in electric vehicle charging data to uncover insights about user behavior, peak usage times, and charging duration trends. By applying SQL queries to analyze charging sessions across different locations and time periods, this analysis provides valuable information for optimizing charging infrastructure and understanding EV adoption patterns.

- [Analyze International Debt Statistics](https://github.com/TerekliTahaBerk/sql-portfolio/tree/main/Real%20World%20Projects%20(DataCamp)/Analyze%20International%20Debt%20Statistics): This project explores international debt data collected by The World Bank across countries worldwide. Through SQL queries, I investigate questions such as the total amount of debt, countries with the highest debts, average debt indicators, and debt distribution patterns. The analysis reveals important insights about global economic patterns and financial challenges faced by different nations.

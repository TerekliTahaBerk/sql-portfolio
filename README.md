# SQL Portfolio
This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of my SQL expertise, highlighting my ability to work with structured data through querying, optimization, and analysis. The projects included in this portfolio cover a broad spectrum of applications, ranging from algorithmic problem-solving to real-world database scenarios, demonstrating my proficiency in handling complex data structures efficiently. Each section of this repository provides insights into different aspects of SQL, ensuring a well-rounded representation of my skills in database management and data analysis.

_Note: Data used in the projects is for demonstration purposes only._

## Instructions for Running SQL Locally
1. To execute the SQL scripts provided in this repository, you will need a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or SQLite.
2. If working with the Northwind database, ensure it is correctly installed and set up in your database environment before running the queries.
3. Explore the queries and projects in a test environment to practice and refine your SQL skills. You can modify and experiment with the queries to gain a deeper understanding of different SQL functionalities.
4. Use query execution plans and performance analysis tools available in your chosen database system to optimize query performance and enhance efficiency.

## Repository Structure

- ### LeetCode Solutions
  - This section contains a collection of SQL solutions to various problems available on the LeetCode platform. Each solution is carefully crafted to demonstrate best practices in writing efficient and optimized SQL queries.
  - The problems cover fundamental and advanced SQL concepts, such as data filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregation. Additionally, more complex topics like multi-table joins, subqueries, common table expressions (CTEs), and window functions are also addressed.
  - By solving these challenges, I have strengthened my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of query performance optimization, making my SQL code more efficient and scalable.

- ### Northwind Exercise
  - This section contains a set of SQL queries and analyses performed on the widely used Northwind database, which simulates a real-world business scenario with customers, orders, suppliers, and products.
  - The queries demonstrate techniques for retrieving and analyzing business-related data, such as sales trends, customer segmentation, supplier relationships, and product performance.
  - Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience in handling structured business data, designing efficient queries for extracting meaningful insights, and optimizing database performance for better efficiency.

- ### Real World Projects (DataCamp)
  - This section includes hands-on SQL projects from DataCamp, focusing on real-world data analysis and business intelligence applications.
  - These projects involve working with large and complex datasets, requiring the application of SQL techniques such as data cleaning, normalization, and indexing to ensure optimal performance.
  - The goal of these projects is to derive actionable insights from data, helping businesses make data-driven decisions based on trends, patterns, and statistical analysis.
  - Through these exercises, I have developed a strong understanding of how SQL is used in business analytics and decision-making, further enhancing my practical expertise in the field.
